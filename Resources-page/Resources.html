                <p>This is for those of you who are interested in a tour in order to have access to a local guide at all times and have
                     logistics taken care of, but are interested in a small group size and a certain level of independence and free time
                      during the tour. The tours are divided into styles — e.g., Classic, Active, 18 to 30-something, National Geographic
                       Journeys — so that you can find the right style and price of tour to match your needs. G Adventures has recently added a Travel with Confidence Plus
                        collection of tours that includes smaller groups,
                        additional space in transport and other features to make you feel comfortable and safe.

                    day trip, boat ride, etc. — then Get Your Guide probably has you covered. It partners with local companies 
                    and entrepreneurs around the world to offer a wide selection of tours and day trips with no additional booking
                     fees and free cancellation up to 24 hours before. Also,
                     Get Your Guide is Berlin based so we consider them as a local partner.

                <p>If you're looking for a walking tour or local experience that is unusual and led
                     by a subject matter expert, then Context Travel is a good fit. Many of their guides 
                     are local experts — e.g., a historian, chef or art specialist — and so the tours go
                      deep into a subject and place. We've taken Context Travel walking tours in Berlin and
                       Cartagena and learned a lot, even about places that we thought we already knew

                    but still not everything. We've also found it useful for booking rental cars as well.

                <p>One of the things that we like about using Skyscanner is that it lists all the low-cost airlines.
                     This is especially useful when we are booking flights within Europe and Asia where there are lots
                      of low-cost airlines that don't always show up in regular flight searches. Skyscanner also has a fun
                       “Everywhere” function so that if you're not sure where you want to go, but know the general timeframe,
                        you can put in your departure city and see the price of flights are to almost anywhere in the world.

                <p>Unlike the other flight search sites above that send you to another site to actually purchase the ticket, at Expedia
                     you book the flight directly through them. We'll often use Expedia as prices are usually similar, you have all your
                      flight information in one account, and it gives 24-hours to change or cancel your reservation. Also, sometimes you 
                      can find great last-minute deals.

                <p>This is another go-to website for flight searches. One of the things that we really like about Momondo is that it offers a
                     monthly view of how prices for your desired flights and route changes. This means that if you have flexibility with dates
                      you can change to the cheapest time in the month.

                     The pants are designed with lots of zippers and pockets so that are great for safely and comfortable holding all 
                     your valuables (phone, keys, wallet, etc.). The fabric is light and easy to dry, plus it repels stains and smells

                <p>We've been using Eagle Creek backpacks for years, and have recently added a couple of their wheeled duffel bags
                     to the mix (Dan uses the 32-inch, Audrey uses the 26-inch). What we like about these bags is that the wheels
                      are wide and sturdy, meaning that they do great if you're walking down a cobblestone street or over uneven ground.
                       We are also huge fans of Eagle Creek packing cubes.
