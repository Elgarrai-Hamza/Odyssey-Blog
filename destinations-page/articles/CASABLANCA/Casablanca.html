                    <p>Made famous by the eponymous 1940s film starring Humphrey Bogart, <br> Casablanca is the economic epicenter of Morocco with equal measures <br> French-colonial design and traditional Moroccan style.</p>

              <div class="details">
                  <h2>Enjoy Some Sea Air along the Corniche</h2>
                  <p>For sea views and fresh sea breezes close to downtown, head to the Hassan II Mosque and stroll the eastern end of Casablanca's Corniche road from here. 
                     You can snap dramatic photographs of the mosque jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean from this vantage point as well. <br><br>

                    The Corniche road trails west from here, along Casablanca's shore, all the way to the city's beachfront district of Ain Diab. <br>
                    
                    Much of Ain Diab's shoreline is now home to luxury hotels and restaurants. The public stretch of beach here isn't particularly clean, so the private beach 
                    clubs do a roaring trade, with sun worshipers lapping up the rays and splashing in the club swimming pools. <br>

              <div class="details">
                  <h2>Take a Tour inside the Hassan II Mosque</h2>
                  <p>On the shoreline, just beyond the northern tip of Casablanca's medina (old city), the Hassan II mosque dominates the entire city. 
                      Finished in 1993, it is the second largest mosque in the world, covering two hectares in size with the world's tallest minaret (200 meters high). <br><br>

                    The prayer hall can accommodate 25,000 worshippers, while the courtyard (which boasts a retractable roof) can fit another 80,000. <br>
                    
                    Astonishingly intricate decoration covers every centimeter of surface. The location, right on the tip of the rocky bay above the ocean, is thoroughly dramatic. <br>
                    
                    Non-Muslims can visit the mosque on free guided tours, which are run by the mosque. The tours begin at the mosque's western entrance several times a day.</p>

                  <h2>Admire Downtown Casablanca's Architecture</h2>
                  <p>Place Mohamed V is the central plaza of Casablanca and is home to many of the city's important official buildings, including the main post office, Palace of Justice, 
                      Prefecture, French consulate, and the main Bank of Morocco. <br><br>

                    The building facades all sport the neo-Moorish style (known as Mauresque) that French Resident-General Lyautey planned out for the city as he set about modernizing Casablanca in the early 20th century. <br>
                    
                    The downtown district of Casablanca between Place Mohamed V and Boulevard Mohamed V is brimming with this style of architecture, which blends Art Deco and Art Nouveau with traditional Moroccan design. <br>

              <div class="details">
                  <h2>Visit Casablanca's Cathedral du Sacre Coeur</h2>
                  <p>This graceful cathedral was built in the 1930s, and its architecture is a harmonious blend of both European and Moroccan style. <br>

                    Unfortunately, it has been left to wither in the past few decades, and is now in need of serious restoration. But even in its current dilapidated state, the structure is still beautiful. <br>
                    
                    Knock on the door, and if you're lucky, the guardian will be on hand and will allow you inside (in exchange for a tip) to see the cathedral's soaring interior. <br>
                    
                    Another church worth visiting in central Casablanca is the modernist-style Notre Dame de Lourdes (on Boulevard Mohamed Zerktouni), built in the 1950s and lit by a vast stained-glass window.</p>
