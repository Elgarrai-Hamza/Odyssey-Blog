                <p>The Gnawa, an ethnic group in Morocco and Algeria, is renowned for its hypnotic trance-like music. 
                    Most notably,the Gnawa use these songs, marked by low-toned rhythmic patterns, 
                    in various spiritual and healing rituals. While you're in the desert, you can visit the Gnawa

                <h2>Traverse the desert in an authentic Berber caravan</h2>
                <p>Traverse the desert the traditional way - your guide will lead you through the winding dunes as you sit atop 
                    your very own Berber camel caravan. To add an extra special touch, ask to have your caravan readied at sunrise or sunset. 
                    The desert sun is simply spectacular, but can be quite hot during mid-day. <br>
                    If you are going to the desert as part of a guided tour my recommendation is to read the itinerary to see if this experience is included; if it is not, contact the organizers to see if there is a way to do it. As an additional tip, camels are really sweet creatures that have adapted wonderfully to contact and life with humans.</p>
