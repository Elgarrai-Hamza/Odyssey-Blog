				<h2>Why You Should Visit Morocco</h2>
			  <p>Located in the Maghreb, which is an Arabic word for Land of the Setting Sun, Morocco is situated in Northern West Africa and offers seismic and breathtaking tourist attractions that are guaranteed to ground you for longer than you anticipated or planned for .</p><br>
			  <h3>Genuine Pot Of Unique Diversity</h3>
			  <p>The country is a true jewel of Northern Africa. Characterized by a coastline that not only touches the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean sea, it also borders the Sahara desert and encompasses a diverse culture that is influenced by the Berbers, Arabs and the Europeans.</p><br>
			  <p>True to this, and a melting pot of cultural diversity that has become a popular tourist destination in Africa, is the town of Marrakech. Visitors here will have the chance to sample delicious Moroccan food delicacies, get to see snake charmers at their very best as well as enjoy shopping sprees in the colorful markets of Jemaa el-fenr. Casablanca, Tangier, and Fez are additional great shopping centers.</p><br>
			  <p>Accommodation suitable for all budgets in a traditional Moroccan Riad is also available and comes highly recommended. These are palaces or traditional houses with beautiful interior gardens; a true gem to behold.</p><br>
			  <p>Moreover, while you are here and possess a respectable inclination towards botany and beautiful art, then a visit to the Majorelle garden located at the center of this auspicious town of Marrakech is also in order.</p><br>
			  <h3>Being one with the universe</h3>
			  <p>If you have ever looked up to the stars in a clear night, you have to agree with me that it is one of the most majestic and humbling of experiences.</p>
			  <p>It greatly diminishes your sense of grandeur in the scheme of things and helps you appreciate your existence as well as the nature that surrounds you.</p><br>
			  <p>Nowhere is this expounded most than when you stand in awe and grace of a desert. As merciless as it may be to those that forge into it unprepared, it beholds an arresting and captivating beauty that to miss it in your lifetime, is indeed, a life less lived.</p><br>
			  <p>So, to really cherish it, make sure to do it in the largest hottest desert in the world – The Sahara – camel excursions or quad tours into the golden dunes and oasis present one of the most glorious ways to experience the mystique and beauty of the desert.</p><br>
			  <p>Therefore, whether you are basking in the sun during the day, or you have sand for your pillow and the stars for your roof, the experience is totally out of this world…In fact, it is enough to make you come again and again.</p><br>
			  <h3>If Trekking or Hiking Makes You Tick</h3>
			  <p>Thanks to tectonic plate movements, the collision of America and Africa many years ago resulted in the formation of the Atlas Mountains.</p>
			  <p>It is this cacophony of the Atlas Mountains, Anti-Atlas Mountains and the Rif Mountains that provides a haven for hiking enthusiasts, In fact, the highest peak in Africa – Mount Toubkal – is located in Morocco. </p><br>
			  <h3>When Form Truly Follows Function – Chefchaouen</h3>
			  <p>When you seek immersion in blue, often times you will gravitate towards the sky or the ocean, but so should you too, to Chefchaouen.</p><br>
			  <p>Situated near Tangier in Northwest Morocco, the town is distinctive in its blue-rinsed buildings and houses that create a one of a kind Instagram city.</p><br>
			  <p>Nowhere is blue manifested in architectural design so beautifully than in Chefchaouen. With nicknames such as ‘The Blue City’, ‘The Blue Pearl’ or ‘The Santorini of Africa’, a visit to this great city comes highly recommended.</p><br>
			  <p>Additionally, as a popular tourist destination, especially, in the summer, be guaranteed to find a multitude of great hotels as well as unique market merchandise that includes but is not limited to; woven blankets, woolen garments as well as native goat cheese – commodities uncommon in the whole of Morocco. </p><br>
			  <p>Furthermore, for those with a daring sense of adventure, the Kef Toghobeit Cave – one of the deepest caves in the continent – is located nearby and offers amazing exploration opportunities.</p>
